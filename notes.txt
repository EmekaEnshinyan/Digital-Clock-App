desiderata:

1. while loop that won't stop 

2. exception to make sure the delays of each iteration are set  

3. increment function to increase each part HH:MM:SS
    be sure to set a limiter, then reset number to 00

4. if the clock is supposed to be displayed on a webpage with synced time, then there may have to be an API call.



var HH = 00
var MM = 00
var SS = 00

while (true){

//check conditions if reset needed
    if (SS == 60)
    if (MM == 60)
    if (HH == 24){
        //i think in js, vars are not static
        HH = 00
        MM = 00
        SS = 00


    }

}
